Learn about the investment oportunities in the first blockchain-enabled wearable sharing ecosystem.

Discover new outfits simply by sharing your clothes with friends on the first decentralized peer-to-peer wardrobe sharing platform.

## Mission

With new wearables at your disposal, a wild array of new and exciting outfits is discovered. Be fashionable everywhere, all the time.

Sharing wearables with friends and family has been done for centuries. We're just providing you with a modern twist to simplify it.

People are generally satisfied with about 20% of their wardrobes. Let those 80% satisfy your friends' and family fashion needs.

## Ecosystem

### Stylists

The Wear & Share ecosystem will feature a wide array of professional stylists who will be able to help users create special outfits when going to important events.

### Influencers

Every user on our platform will have the ability to become a fashion influencer by making their wardrobes publicly visible and having others follow their trends.

Fashion influencers are given a new outreach to their target audience while also provided with new types of collaborations with our partners and stakeholders.

### Brands & Retail

The Wear & Share Business account will provide brands and retail the option to add new wearables and outfits to their wardrobes which users will be able to find on our partners’ public profiles.

Users following our partner brands and retail will start seeing our partners’ items and outfits on their feeds where a simple option to purchase and add them to their wardrobes will be presented.

### Society & Environment

By extending the average wearable lifeteime by a third the carbon savings alone equate to approximately those of 1620 miles driven by a modern car.

When our algorithm discovers some piece has not been worn for a long time and it won’t be worn again, a donation is stimulated to help those with nothing to wear.

## Blockchain

Blockchain enables us to have complete integrity of transactions happening inside the ecosystem while also allowing them to be executed completely decentralized.

With each exchange being encoded no the blockchain, we can ensure our users that their wearables will never get lost. They will always know where their clothes are and were.

Any transaction between users, stylists, influencers, brands and or retail will be transparent, trustworthy and executed only by the respected parties included in the transaction.

You can read about more about blockchain and its use cases on our website.
